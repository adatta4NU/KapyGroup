<h2>Personalized News Aggregation Web Application Using Crawlers</h2>


<br />

<p>
    KAPY’s News is a web application that gathers news from different sources using web crawlers
    , maps them to various categories and provides a personalized selection for the users based
    on their predefined profiles. KAPY’s News supports a recommendation feature that suggests to
    the users the recent news they might be interested in and allows them to get the real time updates
    by sending notifications. KAPY’s News also promotes user interaction by enabling its members to
    make comments on each piece of news. KAPY’s News is implemented with: ASP.Net MVC framework and
    C# for the User Interface development, Python’s BeautifulSoup4 library for web crawling, Lucene.net
    library for the search engine and Microsoft Azure’s Cloud SQL Database and Web App Services for the
    database storage and application deployment. KAPY’s News will be available at this website:
    www.kapysnews.azurewebsites.net
